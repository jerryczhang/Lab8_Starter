1) Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline?
   
   We should fit our automated tests within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed in our Recipe project development pipeline so that we never forget to run tests when we push our code.

2) Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output?
   
   No, that would be better suited for unit testing.
